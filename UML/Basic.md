UML:-
  - Design of the software system so that other can understand easily



Sequence Diagram for understanding the dynamic behaviour of the objects

Architecture Decisions:-

1. Interactions
2. Security
3. Performance
4. Fault Tolerance
5. Robustness
6. Extensibility
7. 3rd party usage.

* Water Model is used in Medical Systems, Life Control Systems, Military Systems

Agile
  - Involve Customer.
  - Provide diff. checkpoints so that it is ensured, project is getting develoepd in the right direction.
  - Useful when the requirements are not clear from the start.
  - Uncertianity is high.

  - No clarity of the end product.

Abstraction
  Describe complex problems by focusing on the essential qualities.

Diagrams
  - Use case diagram
    Actor that interact with the system
    Primary and secondary actors
    System Boundary
    <<extend>> and <<include>> representations

  - Class Diagrams
    For system representation

UML relationships
  - Genralization (is-a)
  - Association (has-a)
  - Aggregation (has-a)
  - Composition (part-of)
  - Dependency (refs)
  - Realization (implements behaviour)

Sequence Diagrams
  - Interaction between objects
